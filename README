NOTE: This is not the offical Gendarme source repository. 

The official repository is:
https://github.com/mono/mono-tools/

This repository is used:
* for unsupported tools (sources) not part of the Gendarme distribution
* download of the win32 installer and ZIPped binaries
* git-based wiki / documentation

In short nothing worth the time (or the electrons) cloning.
