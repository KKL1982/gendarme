NOTE: This is not the official Gendarme source repository. 

The official repository is:
https://github.com/mono/mono-tools/

This repository is used:

* for unsupported tools (sources) not part of the Gendarme distribution

* download of the win32 installer and ZIPped binaries
https://github.com/spouliot/gendarme/downloads

* git-based wiki / documentation
https://github.com/spouliot/gendarme/wiki

In short nothing worth the time (or the electrons) cloning.
